# Personal Website

This project is the source code for my in-development personal website.

I hate frontend, so I want it to be more backend-focused, and so plan on implementing a database
and other fun features.

For now though, there's not much going on here, so it's pretty barebones!

## Spinning up the postgresql server

run docker-compose up, and everything should work.
