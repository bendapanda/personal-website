% About me
\begin{AboutMe}
	I want to work in a job that challenges me to think outside the box, and generate novel solutions to problems.
	As a software engineer I love taking the things I know, and using them to build solutions to real-world problems. As a mathematician I like 
	learning new things, analyzing problems, and projects that force me to make insightful observations! I am fast-paced and keen to learn. I like to push
	myself, and be inspired by the people around me.
\end{AboutMe}

% Experience
\CVSection{Experience}
\CVItem{November 2024 - February 2025, Summer Research Scholar}\\
This year I was lucky enough to be selected to partake in a summer research program through the University of Auckland.
I was given an unsolved problem, and essentially tasked with solving it, with guidance from a lecturer at the University.
This gave me a complete introduction to university-level mathematics research. It was a great exercise in finding unique ways to solve 
problems.

\CVItem{December 2023 - February 2024, Software Intern, Fingermark}\\
This was a summer internship where I was integrated into a full on software development team, working predominantly in python. It was a fast-paced environment which 
gave me a chance to see what being a software developer was really like, and 
was exposed to new technologies, like Docker and Kubernetes. In this short 3-month internship I think I nearly doubled my ability as a developer.
